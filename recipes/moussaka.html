    <h3>What is Moussaka?</h3>
    <p>
      Moussaka is an eggplant - or cauliflower-based dish, often including
      ground meat, which is common in the Balkans and the Middle East, with many
      local and regional variations. We will make one of the Middle Eastern
      versions which uses eggplants, tomatoes, and ground beef.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moussaka can be healthy as long as you don't deepfry the eggplants, which
      is typically how they are prepared for the dish and is the most delicious
      what to do it.
