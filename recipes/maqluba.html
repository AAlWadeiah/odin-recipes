    <h3>What is Maqluba?</h3>
    <p>
      Maqluba is a dish commonly made across various Arabic countries like
      Palestine (where I'm from), Iraq, Jordan and Syria. Each household
      probably has their own way of preparing this famous dish. But one thing
      remains true amongst all versions: it's a layered dish using rice,
      vegetables and meat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea behind layering the vegetables and meat underneath the rice then
      cooking everything together allows all the flavours to beautifully melt
      into each other. It's cooked low and slow to give time for the flavours to
      develop and to also prevent the vegetables from burning, since they're
      underneath the rice. Before we get into the recipe, let's address some
      common questions about Maqluba.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vegetables used in maqluba are eggplant, potato, cauliflower,
      tomatoes, and onions. Different versions use different combinations of
      these. I find that eggplants, tomatoes, and onions give so much flavour
      that makes maqluba delicious (so this is what we will use in my recipe).
      You can add other vegetables you have on hand. There are no hard and fast
      rules when it comes to this!
    </p>
    <p>
      My favourite type of meat to use is bone-in chicken. I find that they're
      tender and create an amazing stock that is used to cook the rice. You can
      also use lamb (shoulder or leg), which also turns out delicious but tends
      to make a fattier end-product.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Bone-in skin-on chicken</li>
      <li>Medium to large onions</li>
      <li>Tomatoe paste</li>
      <li>Basmati rice</li>
      <li>Eggplants</li>
      <li>Tomatoes</li>
      <li>Cooking oil</li>
      <li>Spices, including</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>Green cardamom</li>
        <li>Bay leaves</li>
        <li>Peppercorns</li>
        <li>Cloves</li>
        <li>Allspice</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the eggplant and the tomatoes</li>
      <li>Get started on cooking the chicken and creating the stock</li>
      <li>
        After the meat has cooked, remove it and set aside, and strain the stock
      </li>
      <li>
        Now you can start layering all the vegetables, meat and rice together in
        the pot
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the maqluba on medium high heat for about 7 minutes until it
        bubbles then let simmer on low for about 50 minutes
      </li>
      <li>Turn off the heat and allow the maqluba to rest for a few minutes</li>
      <li>
        Serve by flipping the pot on a serving platter (where the dish gets its
        name)
      </li>
    </ol>
